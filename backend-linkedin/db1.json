At the same time, compliance is becoming more complex, with new regulations like the UK's Biodiversity Net Gain and the US IRA-linked reporting.\n\nWe’re building a unified, AI-powered platform to automate reporting, optimize performance, and simplify compliance for solar asset owners — from pension funds to independent operators.\n\nOur goal is simple: accelerate clean energy with smarter infrastructure.\n\nRole (Volunteer): TypeScript Engineer (React or Node.js).\n\nRole Description: We’re looking for a TypeScript Engineer (frontend or backend) to help us build the foundations of our product. You’ll work directly with the founder on features that transform how asset owners manage and report on solar infrastructure.\n\nThis is an opportunity to build a climate product from the ground up — and help shape both the codebase and product direction.\n\n🔧 What You’ll Help Us Build\nCore functionality for solar reporting workflows\nA clean, intuitive user interface (if frontend-focused)\nRobust APIs and service logic (if backend-focused)\nSimple, scalable architecture that’s easy to extend\nIntegrations with third-party APIs and datasets (e.g. MeterOnline, regulatory data)\n\n⚙️ Tech We’re Using\nTypeScript across the stack\nReact + Tailwind on the frontend\nNode.js, Express, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase on the backend\nPostgreSQL, JWT auth, GraphQL (planned)\nYou don’t need to know all of this — just be excited to learn and build.\n\n🧠 About You\nYou’ve worked with TypeScript, either in React or Node.js\nYou enjoy building from 0–1 and solving messy, real-world problems\nYou’re excited about the climate tech space or want to get involved\n\nTime Commitment: Volunteer 2-3 hours per week for 1-2 months remotely 💻\n\nIf you want to make change, apply to volunteer with The Solar Manager!"

    "description_text": "Who We Are \n\nNeuroFlow CEO and West Point graduate Christopher Molaro served in the army for five years, including a tour in Iraq as a platoon leader. Coming back home, he experienced firsthand the gaps in the behavioral health system and how veterans and civilians alike face too many barriers when it comes to receiving appropriate, timely care.\n\nWhile pursuing his MBA at Wharton, Chris met his future co-founder Adam Pardes, and the two agreed – even the most engaging digital mental health apps in the world wouldn't truly change the problem; only a solution that systematically integrated behavioral health into the full healthcare ecosystem could create meaningful change. And so they created NeuroFlow.\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nWe pride ourselves on partnering with healthcare leaders to assist in driving better outcomes, lowering total cost of care, and making behavioral health risk more predictable and transparent. NeuroFlow exists to make sure no one who needs behavioral health support falls through the cracks.\n\nWe build more than just engaging digital health tools for self-care: we create platforms that identify population behavioral health risk early, engage individuals with acuity-specific resources, and enable care teams to make smarter and more efficient decisions. Together, NeuroFlow's solutions arm healthcare organizations with the insights they need to overcome the systemic challenges in today's healthcare ecosystem.\n\nHow We Do It:\n\nThe award-winning culture at NeuroFlow is one built around encouragement and daring to be great. Our core values have been displayed in our office since day one, and each team member is responsible for carrying out these values and keeping each other accountable to them. We succeed through our flexibility and agility, navigating and transforming an industry ripe for change where \"no\" or \"can't\" is too often the default. NeuroFlow offers unique opportunities to work in a fun and challenging fast-paced environment with direct, meaningful impact on helping to close the divide between mental and physical health.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nThe Neuroflow Platform Engineering team is looking for a Sr. DevOps Engineer familiar with AWS, Terraform, and general CI/CD knowledge to augment our staff to assist in Terraform module development, container deployments and service updates in Elastic Container Service (ECS), and small-scope feature requests in AWS. While you'll have a strong point-of-contact partner to work with, we value the ability to work independently and propose solutions.\n\nWhat You Should Have\n\nA high level of expertise with AWS products and deploying them through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). Ideally, 5+ years working daily with cloud architecture and IaC.\nExperience working with RDS, as well as Serverless deployments such as AWS Lambda\nA thorough understanding of HashiCorp Terraform implementation, deployment principles, and methodology.\nConfidence working with CI/CD pipeline tooling and associated concepts. We use GitLab Pipelines and GitHub Actions, but familiarity with adjacent tooling like Travis, Circle, JenkinsPipeline should translate.\nStrong understanding of a container deployment platform. Ideally ECS on Fargate, but familiarity with Kubernetes+Helm or HashiCorp Nomad will work.\n\nPotential Projects You'll Work On:\n\nAssist with Terraform Modules Updates, Refactors, and Bugfixes.\nCI/CD Pipeline Development for an Upcoming Platform.\nPerformance Tuning of Existing Build Pipeline.\nRDS and Lambda Performance Tuning and Evaluation\nMigration of Docker-On-EC2 Services to ECS Fargate Cluster\nUpgrading Development Tooling in ECS to Current Release\n\nWhat We Believe:\n\nNeuroFlow is a proud equal opportunity employer. Every day we are working to tackle the mental health crisis in America, and in order to do that well, we need diverse voices, experiences, and perspectives at the table. As an equal opportunity employer, we prohibit any unlawful discrimination against a job applicant on the basis of their race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, family or parental status, disability*, age, veteran status, or any other status protected by the laws or regulations in the locations where we operate. We respect the laws enforced by the EEOC and are dedicated to going above and beyond in fostering diversity across our workplace.\n\nApplicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws. A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done which will ensure an equal employment opportunity without imposing undue hardship on NeuroFlow. Please inform our Talent team if you need any assistance completing any forms or to otherwise participate in the application process.\n\nAs a HIPAA compliant organization \n\nAll team members shall:\n\nAct in accordance with NeuroFlow's Information Security Policies. \nProtect organizational assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or interference. \nReport security events or other risks to the organization \nExecute organizational security processes or activities \nPerform security responsibilities that defined and communicated for their role \nBe responsible for their actions regarding the security of organization"
